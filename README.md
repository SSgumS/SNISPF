**SNISPF** is a lightweight command-line tool that helps you get past internet censorship. It works by messing with the way your connection introduces itself to firewalls, so filtered websites slip through undetected. Runs on **Windows, macOS, and Linux** -- no drivers, no admin rights needed for most features.

## How Does It Work?

When you visit a website over HTTPS, your device sends a "hello" message (called a **TLS ClientHello**) that contains the website name in plain text. This is known as the **SNI** (Server Name Indication). Internet censorship systems (called **DPI** -- Deep Packet Inspection) read that name and decide whether to block the connection.

SNISPF sits between your app and the internet. It intercepts that "hello" message and either **chops it up** or **sends a decoy** so the censorship system can't read the real website name. The actual destination server still gets the full, correct message and works normally.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8** or newer (check with `python3 --version` or `python --version`)
- That's it. No external dependencies, no C compilers, no kernel modules.

If you don't have Python yet:

| OS | How to install Python |
|---|---|
| **Windows** | Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During install, **check "Add Python to PATH"**. |
| **macOS** | Run `brew install python` (if you have Homebrew) or download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). |
| **Ubuntu / Debian** | `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip` |
| **Fedora** | `sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip` |
| **Arch** | `sudo pacman -S python python-pip` |
| **Android (Termux)** | `pkg install python` |

---

## Installation

### Method 1: pip install (Recommended)

This installs the `snispf` command system-wide:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rainman69/SNISPF.git
cd SNISPF
pip install .
```

Now you can run it from anywhere:

```bash
snispf --help
```

### Method 2: Run directly without installing

No install needed. Just clone and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rainman69/SNISPF.git
cd SNISPF
python run.py --help
```

### Method 3: Clone from source

If you want to run it as a Python module:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rainman69/SNISPF.git
cd SNISPF
python -m sni_spoofing.cli --help
```

### Method 4: Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rainman69/SNISPF.git
cd SNISPF
docker build -t snispf .
docker run --rm -p 40443:40443 snispf
```

---

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Start the tool

The simplest way to start -- using the default settings:

```bash
snispf -l 0.0.0.0:40443 -c 188.114.98.0:443 -s auth.vercel.com
```

What each part means:

| Flag | What it does | Example value |
|---|---|---|
| `-l` | The local address and port SNISPF listens on | `0.0.0.0:40443` (all interfaces, port 40443) |
| `-c` | The real server IP and port to forward traffic to | `188.114.98.0:443` (a Cloudflare IP) |
| `-s` | The fake website name to show the firewall | `auth.vercel.com` (an allowed domain) |

> **Tip:** If you're not sure what IP or fake SNI to use, the defaults above work for many Cloudflare-based setups.

### Step 2: Point your app at it

Once SNISPF is running, configure your application (web browser, V2Ray, Xray, proxy client, etc.) to connect through:

```
Address: 127.0.0.1
Port:    40443
```

That's it. Your traffic now goes through SNISPF, which handles the bypass automatically.

---

## Configuration

You can configure SNISPF two ways: with a **config file** or with **command-line flags**. Flags override the config file when both are used.

### Using a config file

Generate a default config:

```bash
snispf --generate-config config.json
```

This creates a `config.json` file you can edit. Then run with:

```bash
snispf --config config.json
```

### Using command-line flags

```bash
# Basic usage
snispf -l :40443 -c 188.114.98.0:443 -s auth.vercel.com

# Use the strongest bypass method
snispf -l :40443 -c 188.114.98.0:443 -s dl.google.com -m combined

# See verbose debug output
snispf -l :40443 -c 188.114.98.0:443 -s auth.vercel.com -v

# Check what your system supports
snispf --info
```

### Config file reference

Here's what each field in `config.json` does:

```json
{
  "LISTEN_HOST": "0.0.0.0",
  "LISTEN_PORT": 40443,
  "CONNECT_IP": "188.114.98.0",
  "CONNECT_PORT": 443,
  "FAKE_SNI": "auth.vercel.com",
  "BYPASS_METHOD": "fragment",
  "FRAGMENT_STRATEGY": "sni_split",
  "FRAGMENT_DELAY": 0.1,
  "USE_TTL_TRICK": false,
  "FAKE_SNI_METHOD": "prefix_fake"
}
```

| Field | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `LISTEN_HOST` | IP address to listen on. `0.0.0.0` means all network interfaces. | `0.0.0.0` |
| `LISTEN_PORT` | Port number to listen on locally. | `40443` |
| `CONNECT_IP` | The real server's IP address to forward traffic to. | `188.114.98.0` |
| `CONNECT_PORT` | The real server's port. | `443` |
| `FAKE_SNI` | A website name that is NOT blocked in your region. The firewall will see this instead of the real one. | `auth.vercel.com` |
| `BYPASS_METHOD` | Which bypass technique to use: `fragment`, `fake_sni`, or `combined`. | `fragment` |
| `FRAGMENT_STRATEGY` | How to split the hello message: `sni_split`, `half`, `multi`, or `tls_record_frag`. | `sni_split` |
| `FRAGMENT_DELAY` | How long to wait between sending fragments (in seconds). | `0.1` |
| `USE_TTL_TRICK` | Use the IP TTL trick for extra stealth. Needs root/admin. | `false` |
| `FAKE_SNI_METHOD` | Sub-method for fake_sni: `prefix_fake`, `ttl_trick`, or `disorder`. | `prefix_fake` |

### All CLI flags

```
usage: snispf [-h] [--config CONFIG] [--generate-config PATH]
              [--listen HOST:PORT] [--connect IP:PORT] [--sni HOSTNAME]
              [--method {fragment,fake_sni,combined}]
              [--fragment-strategy {sni_split,half,multi,tls_record_frag}]
              [--fragment-delay SECONDS] [--ttl-trick]
              [--verbose] [--quiet] [--version] [--info]
```

| Flag | Short | Description |
|---|---|---|

## Bypass Methods Explained

### `fragment` (default)

Splits your TLS hello message into multiple pieces so the firewall can't read the website name from any single piece.

**Best for:** Most situations. Works everywhere, no special privileges needed.

```
Normal:   [Full hello: ...SNI=blocked-site.com...]  --> Firewall blocks it

SNISPF:   [Piece 1: ...SN]          --> Firewall sees incomplete name
          [Piece 2: I=blocked-site.com...]  --> Too late, already let through
```

### `fake_sni`

Injects a decoy hello message with an allowed website name that DPI parses, but the server drops.

**Best for:** When fragmentation alone doesn't work. Most effective with root/admin.

**With root (Linux):** Uses raw socket injection to send the fake ClientHello with a TCP sequence number that falls outside the server's receive window. DPI sees it and whitelists the connection. The server drops it because the sequence number is out of range. This is the same technique used by the [original patterniha tool](https://github.com/patterniha/SNI-Spoofing).

**Without root:** Falls back to fragmenting the real ClientHello (same as `fragment` method). Sending a fake ClientHello on the same TCP stream would corrupt the TLS handshake, so we don't do that.

```
With root:    [Fake hello: seq=out-of-window]    --> DPI sees it, server drops it
              [Real hello: seq=normal]            --> Server processes, DPI ignores

Without root: Falls back to fragment method
```

### `combined` (strongest)

Uses both methods at the same time: injects a fake hello (if root is available), then sends the real hello in fragments.

**Best for:** Aggressive DPI systems. This is the most effective option.

**With root:** Injects the fake via raw socket (out-of-window seq trick) and fragments the real ClientHello. Hits DPI from two angles simultaneously.

**Without root:** Fragments only (the fake injection is skipped since it can't be done safely without raw sockets).

```bash
snispf -l :40443 -c 188.114.98.0:443 -s dl.google.com -m combined

# On Linux, run with sudo for the full seq_id trick:
sudo snispf -l :40443 -c 188.114.98.0:443 -s dl.google.com -m combined
```

---

## Fragment Strategies

These control *how* the hello message gets split up (used by `fragment` and `combined` methods):

| Strategy | What it does | When to use it |
|---|---|---|
| `sni_split` | Cuts right through the middle of the website name. | Default and most effective for most firewalls. |
| `half` | Cuts the entire message in half. | Simple fallback if `sni_split` doesn't work. |
| `multi` | Chops into many small 24-byte pieces. | For firewalls that try to reassemble two fragments. |
| `tls_record_frag` | Creates multiple valid TLS records from one message. | For firewalls that understand TLS but don't handle multi-record. |

Example:

```bash
snispf -l :40443 -c 188.114.98.0:443 -s auth.vercel.com --fragment-strategy multi
```

---

## Platform Support

| Platform | Works? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Windows 10 / 11 | Yes | No admin needed for basic methods |
| Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch, etc.) | Yes | Use `sudo` for raw injection (seq_id trick) |
| macOS | Yes | Fragmentation and TTL trick only (no `AF_PACKET`) |
| Android (Termux) | Yes | Install Python first: `pkg install python` |
| WSL / WSL2 | Yes | Works like native Linux |

The `fragment` method works everywhere using standard socket options (`TCP_NODELAY`). The `fake_sni` and `combined` methods are most effective on Linux with root, where they use `AF_PACKET` raw sockets to inject fake packets with out-of-window TCP sequence numbers. Without root, they fall back to fragmentation.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" when starting

Ports below 1024 need root/admin. Use a higher port:

```bash
snispf -l :40443 ...
```

### "Address already in use"

Something else is using that port. Pick a different one:

```bash
snispf -l :50443 ...
```

### It starts but connections don't work

Try these steps in order:

1. **Switch bypass method:** `fragment` -> `combined` -> `fake_sni`
   ```bash
   snispf -l :40443 -c 188.114.98.0:443 -s auth.vercel.com -m combined
   ```

2. **Try different fragment strategies:** `sni_split` -> `multi` -> `tls_record_frag`
   ```bash
   snispf -l :40443 -c 188.114.98.0:443 -s auth.vercel.com --fragment-strategy multi
   ```

3. **Increase the delay between fragments:**
   ```bash
   snispf -l :40443 -c 188.114.98.0:443 -s auth.vercel.com --fragment-delay 0.2
   ```

4. **Try a different fake SNI.** Pick a major website that's not blocked in your area:
   ```bash
   snispf -l :40443 -c 188.114.98.0:443 -s dl.google.com
   ```

5. **Double-check the target IP and port.** Make sure `CONNECT_IP` actually points to the server you want.

### TTL trick doesn't work

The TTL trick needs elevated privileges:

- **Linux / macOS:** Run with `sudo`
- **Windows:** Run the terminal as Administrator

On Linux, consider using `combined` or `fake_sni` with `sudo` instead. The raw injection method (seq_id trick) is more reliable than the TTL trick because it's independent of network topology.

### How do I get the strongest bypass?

On Linux, run as root. This enables raw packet injection which is the same technique as the original [patterniha tool](https://github.com/patterniha/SNI-Spoofing):

```bash
sudo snispf -l :40443 -c 188.114.98.0:443 -s auth.vercel.com -m combined
```

### How do I check what my system supports?

```bash
snispf --info
```

This shows which features are available on your platform.

## How It Works (Technical Deep Dive)

### TLS ClientHello Fragmentation

When a TLS connection starts, the client sends a ClientHello message containing the SNI. DPI systems inspect this to filter connections.

SNISPF splits the ClientHello into multiple TCP segments so the SNI is divided across packets:

```
Normal:   [TLS Record: ...SNI=blocked-site.com...]  --> DPI reads and blocks

SNISPF:   [Fragment 1: ...SN]                       --> DPI sees incomplete SNI
          [Fragment 2: I=blocked-site.com...]        --> DPI can't match pattern
```

This works because many DPI systems only inspect the first TCP segment or don't reassemble the full TCP stream.

### Fake SNI Injection

A fake ClientHello with an allowed SNI is sent before the real one:

```
Step 1:   [Fake ClientHello: SNI=allowed-site.com]  --> DPI allows it
Step 2:   [Real ClientHello: SNI=blocked-site.com]   --> DPI already decided
```

The server ignores the fake because it's a malformed/incomplete handshake.

### TTL Trick

The fake packet is sent with a low IP TTL (Time To Live):

```
Fake packet (TTL=3):  Reaches DPI (2 hops away) but expires before the server
Real packet (TTL=64): Reaches the server normally
```

The DPI sees the fake SNI and allows the traffic. The server never sees the fake packet at all.

## Changelog

### v1.1.0

- **Fixed the seq_id problem** with `fake_sni` and `combined` methods. The old code sent the fake ClientHello as regular data on the same TCP stream, which the server would receive and try to parse as a real TLS record. This corrupted the handshake every time. Now on Linux with root, SNISPF uses `AF_PACKET` raw socket injection to send the fake ClientHello with an out-of-window TCP sequence number (`seq = ISN + 1 - len(fake)`). DPI parses it and whitelists the connection; the server drops it because the sequence number falls before its receive window. This is the same technique used by [patterniha's original tool](https://github.com/patterniha/SNI-Spoofing) and [the Go reimplementation](https://github.com/selfishblackberry177/sni-spoof).
- **Fixed `fake_sni` without raw sockets.** Previously it would send the fake ClientHello on the real TCP stream, breaking the TLS handshake. Now it falls back to fragmenting the real ClientHello at the SNI boundary instead of corrupting the connection.
- **Fixed `combined` without raw sockets.** Same issue -- no longer sends junk data on the real TCP stream. Falls back to fragmentation-only.
- **Fixed the `multi` fragment strategy timeout.** The old 5-byte chunk size produced 100+ fragments with 0.1s delay each, causing a 10+ second stall before the handshake could even complete. Bumped to 24-byte chunks (~22 fragments), which keeps the fragment count reasonable while still splitting the SNI across multiple packets.
- Added `raw_injector.py`: the raw packet sniffer and injector module. Monitors the TCP handshake via `AF_PACKET`, captures the SYN ISN and the 3rd ACK template, injects the fake ClientHello 1ms after the handshake completes, and confirms the server ignored it by watching for an ACK with `ack == ISN + 1`.
- Added `--no-raw` CLI flag to disable raw socket injection even when running as root.
- Platform capability detection now reports `af_packet` and `raw_injection` status.
- Bumped version to 1.1.0.

### v1.0.1

- Fixed `supported_versions` TLS extension in the fake ClientHello builder. The version list length byte was encoded as two bytes (`04 03`) instead of one (`04`), which shifted every extension after it by one byte. This corrupted `psk_key_exchange_modes`, `key_share`, and `padding`, making the fake ClientHello malformed. Strict TLS parsers and some DPI systems would reject it outright.
- Fixed the bidirectional relay task setup. The two relay directions (client-to-server and server-to-client) were referencing the wrong peer task during creation, which could cause one relay direction to fail to clean up when the other direction closed.
- Bumped version to 1.0.1.
